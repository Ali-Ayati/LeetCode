## Solved Problems

### 1. Two Sum
*File:* `1. Two Sum/solution.py`  
*Description: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.*  
<!-- Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1] -->

### 2. Add Two Numbers
*File:* `2. Add Two Numbers/solution.py`  
*Description: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.*  
<!-- Example 1:
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

Example 2:
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Example 3:
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1] -->

### 9. Palindrome Number
*File:* `9. Palindrome Number/solution.py`  
*Description: Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.*  
<!--Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome. -->

## How to Use

Each directory is named based on the LeetCode problem number and title.  
Inside each directory, you will typically find:
- Python solution(s)
- Possibly helper functions (e.g., for building linked lists)
- Optional: Test code or notes
